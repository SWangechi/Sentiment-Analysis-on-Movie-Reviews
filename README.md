Sentiment Analysis on Movie Reviews

**Steps and requirements**
Load the dataset and quickly explore it.
Visualize the distribution of reviews (positive vs. negative).

Convert all text to lowercase to ensure uniformity (e.g., "Great" and "great" should be treated as the same word).

Split the text into individual words or tokens, which are the building blocks for further text processing.

Remove common words (like "the," "is," "and") that do not carry significant meaning for sentiment classification. Use NLTK or SpaCy's predefined stop word lists.

Apply stemming (e.g., reducing "running" to "run") or lemmatization (converting words to their base form, e.g., "better" to "good") to reduce the text to its base form.
:
Convert text into numerical format using or to represent the importance of words in each document.

Clean the text by removing unnecessary characters such as punctuation marks, numbers, and symbols.

Implement a basic method for handling negations (e.g., replacing "not good" with "not_good") to capture the meaning of negation in the sentiment.

:
Select 3 simple classification models suitable for text data e.g. Naive Bayes, SVM etc.
Train and test the above models on your data

:
Evaluate the model using accuracy and visualize a confusion matrix.

:
Present findings, including key data insights, model performance, and any challenges faced.
